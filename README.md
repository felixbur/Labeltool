# Labeltool

This is the GUI for the [Speechalyzer software](https://github.com/felixbur/Speechalyzer), a tool to annotate, transcribe, classify, label, mix etc. large sets of audio data.

There will be a series of blog posts on how to use this, i [started with a first one on how to adapt the configuration](http://blog.syntheticspeech.de/2021/04/28/how-to-adapt-speechalyzer-labeltool-to-you-own-labels-experiments/)
